## AI-Enhanced Discovery Process

### Phase 1: Initial Discovery
1. **AI-Powered Brainstorming**
   - Use ChatGPT to generate requirement categories
   - Explore different user personas and use cases
   - Identify potential edge cases and scenarios

2. **Market Research Automation**
   - Use Perplexity to research competitor features
   - Analyze industry reports and standards
   - Identify emerging trends and requirements

### Phase 2: Stakeholder Analysis
1. **Automated Interview Preparation**

   - Create interview templates based on role
   - Prepare follow-up questions based on responses

2. **Real-Time Analysis**
   - Use AI to analyze interview responses
   - Identify key themes and patterns
   - Flag areas needing clarification

### Phase 3: Requirements Synthesis
1. **Pattern Recognition**
   - AI identifies common themes across stakeholders
   - Detects conflicting requirements
   - Suggests requirement groupings

2. **Gap Analysis**
   - AI compares current requirements with industry standards
   - Identifies missing functional areas
   - Suggests additional requirements

## Practical AI Prompts for Requirements Discovery

### Requirements Generation Prompts

#### Functional Requirements
```
"Generate 10 functional requirements for a [product type] that includes:
- User authentication
- Data management
- Reporting capabilities
- Integration features
Format each requirement with ID, title, description, and acceptance criteria."
```

#### Non-Functional Requirements
```
"Create non-functional requirements for a [product type] focusing on:
- Performance (response time, throughput)
- Security (authentication, authorization, data protection)
- Usability (user experience, accessibility)
- Scalability (growth, load handling)
Include specific metrics and measurable criteria."
```

### Requirements Analysis Prompts

#### Completeness Check
```
"Analyze these requirements for completeness:
[Insert requirements]
Identify:
1. Missing functional areas
2. Unclear or ambiguous statements
3. Potential conflicts or contradictions
4. Areas needing more detail"
```

#### Priority Assessment
```
"Prioritize these requirements based on:
- Business value
- User impact
- Technical complexity
- Implementation effort
Provide rationale for each priority level."
```

- Always review AI-generated content
- Validate against business objectives
- Test requirements with real users

### 4. Documentation
- Document AI prompts and processes
- Track AI-generated vs human-generated requirements
- Maintain audit trail for compliance

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Pitfall: Over-reliance on AI
**Problem**: Accepting AI output without validation
**Solution**: Always review and validate AI-generated requirements

### Pitfall: Generic Requirements
**Problem**: AI generates generic, non-specific requirements
**Solution**: Provide detailed context and constraints in prompts

### Pitfall: Missing Domain Knowledge
**Problem**: AI lacks specific industry knowledge
**Solution**: Combine AI with expert domain knowledge

### Pitfall: Inconsistent Quality
**Problem**: AI output varies in quality
**Solution**: Use consistent prompts and templates
