Priority: [AI-suggested based on business impact]
Description: [AI-generated detailed description]
Acceptance Criteria: [AI-generated testable criteria]
Dependencies: [AI-identified related requirements]
Assumptions: [AI-identified assumptions]
Risks: [AI-identified potential risks]
```

#### AI Template Population
```
"Fill this requirements template for a [product type] with [specific features]:

Template:
[Insert template]

Context:
