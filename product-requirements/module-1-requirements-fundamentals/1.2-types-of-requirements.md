# 1.2 Types of Requirements (Functional vs Non-Functional)

## Functional Requirements

### Definition
Functional requirements describe **what** the system should do - the specific behaviors, features, and capabilities that the product must provide.

### Characteristics
- Describe system behavior
- Define user interactions
- Specify business rules
- Outline data processing
- Detail system responses

### Examples

#### User Authentication
- Users must be able to log in with email and password
- System must validate credentials against user database
- Failed login attempts must be logged and rate-limited
- Users must be able to reset forgotten passwords

#### E-commerce Checkout
- Users must be able to add items to shopping cart
- System must calculate taxes based on user location
- Payment processing must support credit cards and PayPal
- Order confirmation must be sent via email

### Writing Functional Requirements

#### Format
```
As a [user type], I want [functionality] so that [benefit/value]
```

#### Example
```
As a customer, I want to filter products by price range so that I can find items within my budget
```

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Definition
Non-Functional requirements describe **how well** the system should perform - the quality attributes, constraints, and performance characteristics.

### Categories

#### Performance Requirements
- Response time: "System must respond within 2 seconds"
- Throughput: "System must handle 1000 concurrent users"
- Capacity: "System must store 1TB of data"

#### Security Requirements
- Authentication: "All API endpoints must require authentication"
- Authorization: "Users can only access their own data"
- Data protection: "Sensitive data must be encrypted"

#### Usability Requirements
- User interface: "Interface must be intuitive for non-technical users"
- Accessibility: "System must comply with WCAG 2.1 AA standards"
- Learning curve: "New users must complete onboarding in under 5 minutes"

#### Reliability Requirements
- Uptime: "System must be available 99.9% of the time"
- Error handling: "System must gracefully handle network failures"
- Data integrity: "No data loss during system failures"

#### Scalability Requirements
- Growth: "System must scale to 10x current user base"
- Load handling: "System must handle traffic spikes during peak hours"
- Resource efficiency: "System must optimize database queries"

## Requirements Hierarchy

### Business Requirements
- High-level business objectives
- Strategic goals and outcomes
- Market positioning and competitive advantage

### User Requirements
- User needs and expectations
- User workflows and scenarios
- User experience goals

### System Requirements
- Technical specifications
- Integration requirements
- Performance and security constraints

### Software Requirements
- Detailed functional specifications
- User interface requirements
- Data requirements

## AI-Enhanced Requirements Classification

### Automated Categorization
- AI can automatically classify requirements by type
- Pattern recognition for requirement templates
- Consistency checking across requirement types

### Quality Assessment
- AI-powered completeness analysis
- Automated conflict detection
- Requirement prioritization algorithms

### Template Generation
- AI-generated requirement templates
- Industry-specific requirement patterns
- Best practice recommendations

## Best Practices

### Functional Requirements
1. Use clear, unambiguous language
2. Include specific inputs and outputs
3. Define error conditions and handling
4. Specify data validation rules
5. Include user interface details

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. Make requirements measurable
2. Define testable criteria
3. Consider trade-offs between requirements
4. Specify acceptable ranges
5. Include monitoring and alerting

## Common Mistakes

### Functional Requirements
- Too vague: "Users can search"
- Missing edge cases: "System handles user input"
- No error handling: "System processes payments"

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Not measurable: "System should be fast"
- Unrealistic expectations: "Zero downtime"
- Missing context: "Secure system"

## Tools and Templates

### Functional Requirements Template
```
ID: REQ-001
Title: [Requirement Title]
Description: [Detailed description]
Priority: [High/Medium/Low]
Source: [Stakeholder/User Story]
Acceptance Criteria:
- [Criterion 1]
- [Criterion 2]
- [Criterion 3]
```

### Non-Functional Requirements Template
```
ID: NFR-001
Category: [Performance/Security/Usability/etc.]
Metric: [Measurable criteria]
Target Value: [Specific value]
Measurement Method: [How to verify]
```
