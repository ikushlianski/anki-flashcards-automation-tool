# 1.2 Behavioral Mapping

## Core Concept
Motivating people to act ethically while understanding what impacts their ability to take action.

## Key Learning Points
- **Motivation vs. Ability**: The two core drivers of behavior
- **5 Elements That Reduce Psychology**:
  1. **Time**: How long the action takes
  2. **Money**: Financial cost of the action
  3. **Physical Effort**: Physical energy required
  4. **Mental Effort**: Cognitive load involved
  5. **Social Deviance**: Social acceptance of the action

## Practical Applications
- **Behavioral Map Creation**: Visualizing user motivation and ability
- **Activation Threshold Analysis**: Determining if users will take action
- **Friction Identification**: Finding barriers to user action
- **Motivation Enhancement**: Increasing user drive to act

## Exercises
1. **Behavioral Mapping**: Map a key user action using motivation/ability matrix
2. **Friction Audit**: Identify all 5 elements reducing user psychology
3. **Threshold Testing**: Determine if your experience crosses activation threshold

## Key Takeaways
- Behavior = Motivation × Ability
- All 5 elements must be considered when designing for user action
- The activation threshold determines whether users will take action
- Reducing friction is often more effective than increasing motivation
