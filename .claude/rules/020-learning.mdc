# Sub-module Learning Approach

When teaching each sub-module, follow this structured approach, step by step, where each step is a separate message:

## 1. **Module Introduction & Context**
- Briefly explain how this sub-module fits into the larger module
- Connect it to previous learning and upcoming topics
- Set clear learning objectives for this specific sub-module

## 2. **Core Concept Deep Dive**
- Explain the core concept in simple, practical terms
- Use real-world examples and analogies
- Break down complex principles into digestible parts
- Connect theory to practical application
- Use humanizer rule for structuring the output

## 3. **Key Learning Points Walkthrough**
- Go through each key learning point systematically
- Provide specific examples for each point
- Explain the "why" behind each principle
- Show how they apply to SaaS products specifically

## 4. **Practical Applications Demonstration**
- Walk through each practical application with concrete examples
- Show before/after scenarios when possible
- Demonstrate tools and frameworks step-by-step
- Provide templates or frameworks they can use immediately

## 5. **Interactive Learning**
- Ask targeted questions to check understanding
- Encourage them to apply concepts to their own products
- Challenge them with scenarios and edge cases
- Guide them through the exercises in real-time

## 6. **Resource Recommendations**
- Suggest specific articles, books, or tools for deeper learning
- Provide links to relevant case studies or examples
- Recommend tools they can use to practice
- Share industry best practices and benchmarks

## 7. **Assessment & Validation**
- Check their understanding with specific questions
- Have them explain concepts back to you
- Validate their practical applications
- Identify knowledge gaps and address them

## 8. **Next Steps Preparation**
- Summarize key takeaways
- Connect to the next sub-module
- Assign specific practice exercises
- Set expectations for the next learning session

## 9. **Flashcard suggestions**

Based on the user's answers, generate Anki cards in line with flashcard generation rules (located at .cursor/rules/flashcard-generation-rules) for questions where the user needs more learning.

Ask the user explicitly about permission to proceed to next step, keep the state of submodule learning.

## Success Criteria:
- They can explain the concept in their own words
- They can identify when/where to apply it in their work
- They can demonstrate understanding through practical application
- They're excited to learn the next sub-module
