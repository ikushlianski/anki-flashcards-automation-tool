# 2.7 Cognitive Load Theory

## Core Concept
Understanding and managing the mental effort required for users to process information and complete tasks.

## Key Learning Points
- **Intrinsic Load**: The inherent complexity of the task itself
- **Extraneous Load**: Unnecessary cognitive effort caused by poor design
- **Germane Load**: Mental effort that contributes to learning and understanding
- **Load Management**: Balancing different types of cognitive load
- **Load Reduction**: Strategies for minimizing unnecessary cognitive effort

## Cognitive Load Management Strategies
- **Chunking Information**: Breaking complex information into manageable chunks
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Revealing information gradually
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Using design to guide attention and reduce effort
- **Consistent Patterns**: Using familiar patterns to reduce learning effort
- **Error Prevention**: Preventing errors that increase cognitive load

## Practical Applications
- **Interface Design**: Designing interfaces that minimize cognitive load
- **Content Strategy**: Organizing content to reduce mental effort
- **Task Flow Design**: Creating task flows that are easy to follow
- **Learning Experience Design**: Designing experiences that support learning
- **Error Handling**: Creating error states that don't increase cognitive load

## Exercises
1. **Cognitive Load Audit**: Audit your product for cognitive load issues
2. **Information Chunking**: Break complex information into digestible chunks
3. **Progressive Disclosure Design**: Design experiences that reveal information gradually
4. **Load Reduction Strategy**: Develop strategies to reduce cognitive load

## Key Takeaways
- Cognitive load directly affects user performance and satisfaction
- Extraneous load should be minimized through good design
- Intrinsic load can be managed through task simplification
- Germane load should be optimized for learning and understanding
- Load management is essential for complex products and tasks
