# 2.2 Fast vs. Logical Thinking

## Core Concept
Understanding how people think in two different modes and how to design for both.

## Key Learning Points
- **System 1 (Fast Thinking)**:
  - Automatic, intuitive, emotional
  - Quick decisions and reactions
  - Pattern recognition and gut feelings
  - Prone to cognitive biases

- **System 2 (Logical Thinking)**:
  - Deliberate, analytical, rational
  - Slow, effortful processing
  - Problem-solving and reasoning
  - More accurate but energy-intensive

## Practical Applications
- **Dual-Process Design**: Creating experiences for both thinking modes
- **Bias Mitigation**: Reducing System 1 errors through design
- **Cognitive Load Management**: Balancing fast and slow thinking
- **Decision Support**: Helping users make better choices

## Exercises
1. **Thinking Mode Analysis**: Identify which mode users are in at each step
2. **Bias Prevention**: Design to reduce common System 1 errors
3. **Cognitive Load Optimization**: Balance simplicity with functionality

## Key Takeaways
- Users operate in two distinct thinking modes
- System 1 is fast but error-prone, System 2 is accurate but slow
- Good design supports both modes appropriately
- Cognitive load management is crucial for user success
