Astro uses {{c1::Islands architecture::architectural pattern}} to minimize client-side JavaScript.	This approach delivers only interactive components to the browser, unlike Next.js which hydrates the entire page by default. Each island is an isolated interactive component in a sea of static HTML.	Web dev::META FRAMEWORKS::Astro::01-Core-Concepts::Islands-Architecture
By default, Astro components render to {{c1::HTML and CSS only::output format}} with {{c2::zero JavaScript::default behavior}} sent to the client.	This contrasts sharply with React/Next.js where client-side JavaScript is bundled and sent for hydration even for purely static content. Astro strips all JavaScript from the final page by default.	Web dev::META FRAMEWORKS::Astro::01-Core-Concepts::Islands-Architecture
To make an Astro component interactive, you must add a {{c1::client directive::hydration control}} like <code>client:load</code> or <code>client:visible</code>.	These directives tell Astro to bundle the component's JavaScript and send it to the client. Without a directive, the component remains static HTML only. This is the opposite of Next.js where interactivity is the default.	Web dev::META FRAMEWORKS::Astro::01-Core-Concepts::Islands-Architecture
The <code>client:load</code> directive {{c1::loads and hydrates JavaScript immediately::timing behavior}} when the page loads.	Use this for high-priority UI elements that need immediate interactivity, like a buy button or critical navigation. In Next.js, all components hydrate on load by default, making this optimization manual in Astro.	Web dev::META FRAMEWORKS::Astro::01-Core-Concepts::Islands-Architecture
The <code>client:idle</code> directive hydrates the component when {{c1::the browser is idle::timing condition}}.	This uses <code>requestIdleCallback</code> to defer hydration until after critical page load tasks complete. Great for non-critical interactive widgets. Next.js doesn't offer this granular control out of the box.	Web dev::META FRAMEWORKS::Astro::01-Core-Concepts::Islands-Architecture
The <code>client:visible</code> directive hydrates when {{c1::the component enters the viewport::visibility condition}}.	Uses IntersectionObserver to lazy-load JavaScript only when the user scrolls to the component. Perfect for below-the-fold interactive elements like comment sections. This level of automatic code-splitting is unique to Astro's Islands.	Web dev::META FRAMEWORKS::Astro::01-Core-Concepts::Islands-Architecture
The <code>client:media</code> directive hydrates based on a {{c1::CSS media query::conditional rule}}.	Example: <code>client:media="(max-width: 600px)"</code> only sends JavaScript on mobile devices. This responsive JavaScript loading is not available in Next.js without custom implementation.	Web dev::META FRAMEWORKS::Astro::01-Core-Concepts::Islands-Architecture
The <code>client:only</code> directive {{c1::skips server rendering::rendering behavior}} and renders the component only on the client.	Use this for components that depend on browser APIs not available during SSR. The component won't appear in initial HTML. Similar to Next.js dynamic imports with <code>ssr: false</code>.	Web dev::META FRAMEWORKS::Astro::01-Core-Concepts::Islands-Architecture
In Astro's Islands architecture, each interactive component is {{c1::independent and isolated::component relationship}}.	Islands cannot directly share state with each other without external state management like nano stores. This differs from Next.js where all components share the React context tree and can easily communicate.	Web dev::META FRAMEWORKS::Astro::01-Core-Concepts::Islands-Architecture
Astro's Islands approach results in {{c1::40% faster::performance metric}} load times with {{c2::90% less JavaScript::bundle size}} compared to typical React frameworks.	This dramatic improvement comes from shipping only the JavaScript actually needed for interactivity. Next.js requires the entire React runtime plus hydration code for every page, even static ones.	Web dev::META FRAMEWORKS::Astro::01-Core-Concepts::Islands-Architecture
Components without client directives in Astro are called {{c1::static components::component type}} and send no JavaScript to the browser.	These components are rendered to HTML once during the build or on the server, then serve as plain HTML/CSS. Think of them like PHP templates that just output markup, not like React components.	Web dev::META FRAMEWORKS::Astro::01-Core-Concepts::Islands-Architecture
When multiple components on a page use the same framework, Astro sends the framework {{c1::only once::optimization behavior}}.	For example, if you have 5 React components with <code>client:load</code>, React is downloaded once and shared. This is more efficient than Next.js which bundles React globally regardless of usage.	Web dev::META FRAMEWORKS::Astro::01-Core-Concepts::Islands-Architecture
Astro's Islands architecture is best suited for {{c1::content-driven websites::use case}} rather than highly interactive applications.	Sites like blogs, marketing pages, documentation, and e-commerce work great. For SPAs with complex state management and heavy client-side routing, traditional React/Next.js might be more appropriate.
