# 1.1 What are Product Requirements?

## Definition
Product requirements are detailed descriptions of what a product should do, how it should behave, and what constraints it must satisfy. They serve as the bridge between business objectives and technical implementation.

## Core Components

### Functional Requirements
- **What** the product should do
- Specific features and capabilities
- User interactions and workflows
- Business logic and rules

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **How well** the product should perform
- Performance, security, usability
- Scalability and reliability
- Compliance and standards

## Why Requirements Matter

### For Business
- Aligns product with business goals
- Reduces scope creep and feature bloat
- Enables accurate cost estimation
- Facilitates stakeholder buy-in

### For Development
- Provides clear implementation guidance
- Reduces ambiguity and rework
- Enables accurate effort estimation
- Supports testing and validation

### For Users
- Ensures user needs are met
- Creates consistent user experience
- Enables proper usability testing
- Supports user adoption

## Characteristics of Good Requirements

### SMART Criteria
- **Specific**: Clear and unambiguous
- **Measurable**: Quantifiable and testable
- **Achievable**: Realistic given constraints
- **Relevant**: Aligned with business goals
- **Time-bound**: Deliverable within timeframe

### Additional Qualities
- **Complete**: Covers all necessary aspects
- **Consistent**: No contradictions
- **Traceable**: Linked to business objectives
- **Verifiable**: Can be tested and validated

## Common Pitfalls

### Vague Requirements
❌ "The system should be fast"
✅ "The system should respond to user queries within 2 seconds"

### Missing Context
❌ "Users can upload files"
✅ "Users can upload files up to 10MB in PDF, DOC, or DOCX format"

### Assumptions
❌ "The system will integrate with existing tools"
✅ "The system will integrate with Salesforce via REST API"

## AI Integration Opportunities

### Requirements Generation
- Use AI to generate initial requirement drafts
- Leverage templates and patterns
- Automate requirement formatting

### Quality Assurance
- AI-powered requirement validation
- Automated consistency checking
- Gap analysis and completeness review
