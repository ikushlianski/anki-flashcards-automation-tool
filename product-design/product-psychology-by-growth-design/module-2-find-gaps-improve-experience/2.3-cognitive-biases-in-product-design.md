# 2.3 Cognitive Biases in Product Design

## Core Concept
Understanding how cognitive biases affect product usage and how to leverage them ethically.

## Key Biases to Master
- **Confirmation Bias**: Users seek information that confirms their beliefs
- **Anchoring Bias**: First impressions heavily influence subsequent judgments
- **Loss Aversion**: Users feel losses more strongly than equivalent gains
- **Social Proof**: Users follow the behavior of others
- **Availability Heuristic**: Users overestimate the likelihood of easily recalled events
- **Framing Effect**: How information is presented affects decisions

## Practical Applications
- **Bias Identification**: Recognizing which biases affect your users
- **Ethical Leverage**: Using biases to help users make better decisions
- **Bias Mitigation**: Reducing negative effects of biases
- **User Education**: Helping users understand their own biases

## Exercises
1. **Bias Audit**: Identify which biases affect your product experience
2. **Ethical Application**: Design to leverage biases for user benefit
3. **Bias Testing**: Test how different presentations affect user behavior

## Key Takeaways
- Cognitive biases are universal and predictable
- Ethical design uses biases to help users, not manipulate them
- Understanding biases helps predict user behavior
- Bias mitigation can improve user decision-making
