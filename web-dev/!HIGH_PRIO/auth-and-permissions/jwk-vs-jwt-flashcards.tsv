JWK stands for {{c1::JSON Web Key::standard name}} and provides a {{c2::uniform way to exchange public/private keys::purpose}} between systems in {{c3::JSON format::format}}.	Unlike PEM format which is text-based with BEGIN/END markers, JWKs are native JSON objects. Used extensively in OAuth2/OIDC where identity providers publish public keys via JWKS endpoints at <code>/.well-known/jwks.json</code> for JWT verification.	Web dev::!HIGH_PRIO::Auth & Permissions
JWT stands for {{c1::JSON Web Token::standard name}}, a compact {{c2::URL-safe::transport property}} means of representing {{c3::claims::data type}} to be transferred between parties. JWTs are {{c4::stateless and self-contained::key characteristic}}.	JWTs consist of three base64url-encoded parts: <code>header.payload.signature</code>. Unlike session cookies that require server-side session storage, JWTs carry all necessary information within themselves. Common in modern auth flows, especially microservices where services can verify tokens without calling a central auth server.	Web dev::!HIGH_PRIO::Auth & Permissions
The fundamental difference: JWK is {{c1::a key representation format::purpose}}, while JWT is {{c2::a signed/encrypted data token::purpose}}.	Think of JWK as the key itself (like a physical key) and JWT as the locked box (the data). You use a JWK private key to sign a JWT and a JWK public key to verify it. JWKs are reusable cryptographic material, JWTs are single-use data containers. In practice, identity providers publish JWKs at /.well-known/jwks.json for clients to verify JWTs.

A JWK object contains the {{c1::kty::required field}} field indicating key type and {{c2::key-specific material::content}}. For RSA keys, required fields are {{c3::n (modulus) and e (exponent)::RSA components}}. Optional fields include {{c4::kid, alg, use::metadata fields}}.	Supported <code>kty</code> values: RSA, EC, oct (symmetric), OKP, none. For EC keys: <code>crv</code> (curve), <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> are required. The <code>kid</code> (key ID) is crucial for key rotation as it helps match JWT headers to specific keys in a JWKS. Example: <code>{"kty":"RSA","n":"whYOFK2...","e":"AQAB","kid":"2024-01"}</code>	Web dev::!HIGH_PRIO::Auth & Permissions
JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) is {{c1::a collection of JWKs::definition}} exposed at a {{c2::public endpoint::access type}} for {{c3::key discovery and rotation::purpose}}. To verify a JWT, match the {{c4::kid::JWT header field}} claim to a JWK in the set.	JWKS structure: <code>{"keys":[{jwk1},{jwk2}]}</code>. OAuth2/OIDC providers typically expose JWKS at <code>/.well-known/jwks.json</code>. This enables seamless key rotation without updating every client application. Libraries like jose provide <code>createRemoteJWKSet(url)</code> for automatic fetching and caching.	Web dev::!HIGH_PRIO::Auth & Permissions
To sign a JWT, you import the {{c1::JWK private key::key type}} and pass it to the signing function with {{c2::claims::payload}} and {{c3::protected header::metadata}}. The JWK must contain {{c4::private key components::requirement}} (d for RSA).	Using jose: <code>const privateKey = await importJWK(jwk, 'RS256'); const jwt = await new SignJWT({claim: true}).setProtectedHeader({alg: 'RS256'}).sign(privateKey);</code> The resulting JWT header contains <code>alg</code> and optionally <code>kid</code> to reference the key, but never the full key material itself.	Web dev::!HIGH_PRIO::Auth & Permissions
To verify a JWT, you import the {{c1::JWK public key::key type}} and pass it to the verification function. The JWK must be {{c2::public only::key requirement}} (no d component). Verification checks the {{c3::signature::cryptographic check}} and optionally validates {{c4::claims like iss, aud, exp::JWT validation}}.	Using jose: <code>const publicKey = await importJWK(jwk, 'RS256'); const {payload, protectedHeader} = await jwtVerify(jwt, publicKey, {issuer: 'urn:example:issuer', audience: 'urn:example:audience'});</code> For RSA public keys: only <code>n</code> and <code>e</code> are present, no <code>d</code> (private exponent).

JWK thumbprint is a {{c1::hash-based identifier::type}} calculated from {{c2::specific JWK parameters::source}}, providing a {{c3::deterministic way to reference keys::purpose}} independent of kid. Fields must be {{c4::sorted alphabetically::requirement}} in canonical JSON.	For RSA keys, thumbprint uses SHA-256 hash of only required fields: <code>{"e":"AQAB","kty":"RSA","n":"..."}</code>. Use cases: content-addressable key storage, detecting duplicate keys across systems, or when you need a stable identifier that doesn't depend on optional metadata like <code>kid</code>.

Converting a JWK private key to public involves {{c1::removing private key components::operation}} (d, p, q, dp, dq, qi for RSA) while keeping {{c2::public parameters::what to keep}} (kty, n, e). Never expose JWKs with the {{c3::d parameter::critical security}}.	Using jose: <code>const publicJwk = privateJwk.toPublic()</code>. This is essential when publishing public keys in JWKS endpoints while keeping private keys secure server-side. A leaked <code>d</code> parameter means your private key is compromised and can be used to forge signatures.	Web dev::!HIGH_PRIO::Auth & Permissions
In OAuth2/OIDC, identity providers {{c1::publish JWKs at /.well-known/jwks.json::IdP responsibility}} and clients {{c2::fetch JWKs to verify JWTs::client responsibility}} without {{c3::pre-shared secrets::security model}}. Clients match JWT {{c4::kid header::matching field}} to find the correct JWK.	Flow: 1) User authenticates, receives JWT with <code>kid</code> in header. 2) Client fetches JWKS from IdP endpoint. 3) Client finds JWK matching <code>kid</code>. 4) Verifies JWT signature. This enables zero-trust architecture where clients only need the public JWKS URL. Libraries like jose provide <code>createRemoteJWKSet(url)</code> for automatic fetching and caching.
