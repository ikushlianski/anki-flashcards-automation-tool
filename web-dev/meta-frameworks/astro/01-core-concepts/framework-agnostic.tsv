Astro supports multiple UI frameworks including {{c1::React, Vue, Svelte, Solid, and Preact::framework list}}.	Unlike Next.js which is React-only, Astro lets you choose the best framework for each component. You can even mix them in the same project, though most developers stick to one primary framework.	Web dev::META FRAMEWORKS::Astro::01-Core-Concepts::Framework-Agnostic
Astro recognizes framework components by their {{c1::file extension::identification method}} like .jsx, .vue, .svelte.	The build system automatically applies the correct transformations. No manual configuration needed for basic usage. Just install the integration and Astro handles the rest based on file extensions.	Web dev::META FRAMEWORKS::Astro::01-Core-Concepts::Framework-Agnostic
Only {{c1::.astro components::component type}} can contain components from multiple frameworks in the same file.	Framework component files (like .jsx or .vue) can only contain their own framework's syntax. Think of .astro files as the glue that combines different frameworks. React components can't directly import Vue components.	Web dev::META FRAMEWORKS::Astro::01-Core-Concepts::Framework-Agnostic
When using multiple JSX frameworks, use the {{c1::include option::configuration setting}} in astro.config to specify which files belong to each framework.	<code>react({ include: ['**/react/*'] })</code> tells Astro to treat files in the react folder as React components. This prevents conflicts when using React, Preact, and Solid together.	Web dev::META FRAMEWORKS::Astro::01-Core-Concepts::Framework-Agnostic
By default, framework components in Astro are rendered as {{c1::static HTML::default behavior}} without sending their framework's JavaScript to the client.	A React component becomes just HTML unless you add <code>client:load</code>. The React library isn't sent to the browser at all for static components. This is impossible in Next.js.	Web dev::META FRAMEWORKS::Astro::01-Core-Concepts::Framework-Agnostic
Framework components in Astro are {{c1::independent islands::architectural model}} that don't share state by default.	Two React components with <code>client:load</code> can't share context unless you add state management like nano stores. In Next.js, React Context works across all components automatically.	Web dev::META FRAMEWORKS::Astro::01-Core-Concepts::Framework-Agnostic
When multiple components use the same framework on a page, Astro sends the framework library {{c1::only once::optimization}}.	If you have 5 Vue components with client directives, Vue.js is downloaded once and shared. More efficient than separate bundles, but still requires explicit opt-in unlike Next.js.	Web dev::META FRAMEWORKS::Astro::01-Core-Concepts::Framework-Agnostic
Astro's framework-agnostic approach allows you to {{c1::incrementally migrate::migration strategy}} from one framework to another without downtime.	Start rewriting React components as Svelte one at a time while the app keeps running. Both frameworks coexist peacefully. Impossible in framework-specific tools like Next.js or SvelteKit.	Web dev::META FRAMEWORKS::Astro::01-Core-Concepts::Framework-Agnostic
You can choose {{c1::different frameworks for different components::flexibility}} based on which framework best suits each component's needs.	Use React for a complex data table with an existing library, Vue for a simple form, and Svelte for an animation. Pick the right tool for each job rather than being locked into one ecosystem.	Web dev::META FRAMEWORKS::Astro::01-Core-Concepts::Framework-Agnostic
Astro supports mixing frameworks to enable {{c1::collaboration across teams::team benefit}} working in different frameworks on the same project.	The design team can use Vue while the data team uses React, all in one codebase. This is a unique advantage for large organizations with diverse skill sets.	Web dev::META FRAMEWORKS::Astro::01-Core-Concepts::Framework-Agnostic
Use {{c1::native Astro components::recommended approach}} for static content, and framework components only when you need framework-specific features.	Astro components are simpler and faster. Only reach for React/Vue/Svelte when you need their ecosystems (libraries, hooks, stores) or are reusing existing components from a Next.js/Nuxt app.	Web dev::META FRAMEWORKS::Astro::01-Core-Concepts::Framework-Agnostic
Framework components can be nested as {{c1::children::composition pattern}} within parent Astro files, and each can have its own client directive.	Import both React and Svelte components, render them as siblings or nested, and give each different hydration strategies. This recursive composition is a core Islands pattern feature.
