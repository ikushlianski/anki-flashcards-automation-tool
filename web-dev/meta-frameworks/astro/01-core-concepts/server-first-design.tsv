Astro's {{c1::server-first::architectural approach}} design means rendering happens on the server rather than in the browser as much as possible.	This follows traditional server-side frameworks like PHP and Ruby on Rails. Unlike Next.js which was built for client-side rendering with SSR added later, Astro is server-first from the ground up.	Web dev::META FRAMEWORKS::Astro::01-Core-Concepts::Server-First-Design
By default, Astro components render with {{c1::zero JavaScript::default footprint}} added to the client bundle.	Everything renders to static HTML/CSS unless you explicitly opt-in with client directives. Next.js sends React runtime and hydration code by default, even for static pages that never change.	Web dev::META FRAMEWORKS::Astro::01-Core-Concepts::Server-First-Design
Astro components {{c1::don't render on the client::rendering location}}, they render to HTML at build-time or on-demand on the server.	JavaScript in component frontmatter is stripped from the final page. Only HTML/CSS reaches the browser unless you add <code>client:*</code> directives. This is fundamentally different from React components which always include JavaScript.	Web dev::META FRAMEWORKS::Astro::01-Core-Concepts::Server-First-Design
The server-first approach {{c1::moves expensive rendering::performance benefit}} off client devices to more powerful servers.	Heavy computation, data fetching, and rendering happens server-side where resources are abundant. The client receives lightweight HTML. Next.js SSR does this too, but still sends hydration JavaScript.	Web dev::META FRAMEWORKS::Astro::01-Core-Concepts::Server-First-Design
Astro's zero-JS default protects developers from {{c1::accidentally sending unnecessary JavaScript::safety feature}} that might slow down their website.	Every piece of client JavaScript must be explicitly requested with a directive. Next.js makes it easy to accidentally ship large dependencies because everything is client-bundled by default.	Web dev::META FRAMEWORKS::Astro::01-Core-Concepts::Server-First-Design
In Astro, you {{c1::opt-in to client rendering::mental model}} when needed, rather than opting out of it.	This inverts the typical React paradigm. Instead of assuming everything runs on the client and using <code>use server</code>, you assume server-only and use <code>client:load</code> for interactivity.	Web dev::META FRAMEWORKS::Astro::01-Core-Concepts::Server-First-Design
Server-first rendering keeps Astro sites {{c1::fast by default::performance characteristic}} without requiring optimization expertise.	Developers can't accidentally create slow sites by importing heavy client-side libraries. In Next.js, it's easy to import a large library and inadvertently ship it to every client.	Web dev::META FRAMEWORKS::Astro::01-Core-Concepts::Server-First-Design
Astro leverages server rendering like {{c1::traditional server-side frameworks::comparison}} such as PHP, WordPress, and Ruby on Rails have done for decades.	The difference is Astro lets you write modern component-based code with TypeScript while maintaining the performance benefits of server rendering. Best of both worlds.	Web dev::META FRAMEWORKS::Astro::01-Core-Concepts::Server-First-Design
Unlike modern JavaScript frameworks built for {{c1::client-side rendering::original purpose}}, Astro was designed for server rendering from day one.	Next.js, SvelteKit, Nuxt, and Remix were originally client-focused with SSR added for performance. Astro inverts this: server-first with optional client interactivity.	Web dev::META FRAMEWORKS::Astro::01-Core-Concepts::Server-First-Design
With server-first design, data fetching happens {{c1::on the server::execution location}} using standard <code>fetch()</code> without special Next.js functions like <code>getServerSideProps</code>.	Just use <code>await fetch()</code> in component frontmatter. No need to learn framework-specific data fetching APIs. The code runs server-side automatically, never exposing API keys to clients.	Web dev::META FRAMEWORKS::Astro::01-Core-Concepts::Server-First-Design
Astro's server-first approach results in a {{c1::faster site::performance outcome}} with minimal JavaScript footprint, making it ideal for content-driven websites.	Blogs, marketing sites, documentation, and e-commerce catalogs benefit most. If you're building a highly interactive SPA like a dashboard, you might prefer Next.js's client-first approach.	Web dev::META FRAMEWORKS::Astro::01-Core-Concepts::Server-First-Design
In Astro, client-side JavaScript is treated as an {{c1::enhancement::progressive approach}}, not a requirement, following progressive enhancement principles.	Start with working HTML/CSS, add JavaScript only where needed for interactivity. The site remains functional even if JavaScript fails to load. Next.js typically requires JavaScript for basic functionality.	Web dev::META FRAMEWORKS::Astro::01-Core-Concepts::Server-First-Design
